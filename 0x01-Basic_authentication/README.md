# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Back-end Authentication

**By: Guillaume, CTO at Holberton School**

**Weight:** 1

**Project Start:** Aug 7, 2023 6:00 AM

**Project End:** Aug 9, 2023 6:00 AM

**Checker Released:** Aug 7, 2023 6:00 PM

**Auto Review:** Launched at the deadline

## Background Context

In this project, you will learn about the authentication process and implement Basic Authentication on a simple API.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, it is recommended to use established authentication modules or frameworks rather than implementing your own Basic authentication system. For the purpose of learning, we will walk through each step of this mechanism.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=501dpx2IjGY)
- [Base64 in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html)
- [HTTP Header Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Base64 - Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of external resources:

### General

- What authentication means
- What Base64 is
- How to encode a string in Base64
- What Basic Authentication means
- How to send the Authorization header

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should adhere to the PEP 8 style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Documentation is not just a simple word; it should provide a sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Tasks

### 0. Simple-basic-API

**Description:** Download and start your project from the provided `archive.zip`. This archive contains a simple API with a User model. User data is stored using serialization/deserialization in files.

**Setup and Start Server:**

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ API_HOST=0.0.0.0 API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app
```

**Use the API:**

```bash
$ curl "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status" -vvv
```

### 1. Error Handler: Unauthorized

**Description:** Implement an error handler for HTTP status code 401 (Unauthorized). The response should be a JSON object: `{"error": "Unauthorized"}`. You should use the `jsonify` function from Flask.

### 2. Error Handler: Forbidden

**Description:** Implement an error handler for HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden). The response should be a JSON object: `{"error": "Forbidden"}`. Use the `jsonify` function from Flask.

### 3. Auth Class

**Description:** Create a class named `Auth` in the `api/v1/auth` directory. The class should have three public methods: `require_auth`, `authorization_header`, and `current_user`. This class will serve as the template for all authentication systems you will implement.

### 4. Define Excluded Paths

**Description:** Update the `require_auth` method in the `Auth` class to allow for excluding paths from authentication. Paths ending with a `/` are also slash tolerant. The method should return `True` if the path should not be authenticated.

### 5. Request Validation

**Description:** Enhance the `authorization_header` method in the `Auth` class to validate requests. If the header key `Authorization` is missing or the value is not a valid Basic Authorization header, a 401 error should be raised.

### 6. Basic Auth Class

**Description:** Create a class named `BasicAuth` that inherits from the `Auth` class. In the `api/v1/app.py` file, instantiate the appropriate authentication class based on the `AUTH_TYPE` environment variable.

### 7. Extract Base64 Authorization Header

**Description:** Implement the `extract_base64_authorization_header` method in the `BasicAuth` class. This method should extract the Base64 part from the Authorization header for Basic Authentication.

### 8. Decode Base64 Authorization Header

**Description:** Implement the `decode_base64_authorization_header` method in the `BasicAuth` class. This method should decode a Base64 encoded string and return it as a UTF-8 string.

### 9. Extract User Credentials

**Description:** Implement the `extract_user_credentials` method in the `BasicAuth` class. This method should extract the user email and password from a decoded Base64 Authorization header.

### 10. User Object from Credentials

**Description:** Implement the `user_object_from_credentials` method in the `BasicAuth` class. This method should return the corresponding
